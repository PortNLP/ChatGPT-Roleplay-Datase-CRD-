# ChatGPT Roleplay Datase (CRD)
This repository hosts the dataset associated with our paper titled "[ChatGPT Role-play Dataset: Analysis of User Motives and Model Naturalness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18121)". Our work has been accepted for presentation at the LREC-COLING 2024 conference.

## Dataset Overview
- vanilla.csv: Represents the interactions without specific role-play instructions.
- boss.csv: Interactions where ChatGPT plays the role of a user's boss.
- classmate.csv: Interactions with ChatGPT acting as the user's classmate.
  
Each turn was coded with user motives of user responses, or the perceived naturalness of ChatGPT responses.
